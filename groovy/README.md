# Jenkins groovy scripts for credentials

Groovy is an object-oriented, static and dynamic language whose features are similar to Python. 
It was first released in January 2007.

Test these scripts using the Jenkins script console:

* [Jenkins all credentials](jenkins-all-creds.groovy)
* [Jenkins dump credentials](jenkins-dump-credentials.groovy)
